# Bismuth-184
As the name implies this project might be very unstable and can break down in the blink of an eye. When it's running it's an integrated development environment for Python/C/C++/Java/Bash.

![A screenshot of the IDE open on the left with a terminal window on the right showing the output of a simple hello world program in C++. There is also a (partially broken :D) find box with multiple options (that kind of work)](screenshot.png)
