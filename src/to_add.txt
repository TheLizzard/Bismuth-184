Editor:
* Implement the replace part of `FindReplaceManager`
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
* `FindReplaceManager` removes hit tag when the user adds/removes text near the hit
* Commenting a block with a comment inside it, uncomments the comment
* Control(-Shift)?-z doesn't scroll if there is text selected
* Rework `BasePlugin.find_bracket_match` to use `BasePlugin.text_replace_tag`
* On Control-j and Control-l, undo moves insert to the end of the line
* Control-j and Control-l move the viewport to the end of the longest line
* Unclosed bracket in `FindReplaceManager` with "whole word" fails text="a()\na(x)", search="a("
* On Windows, the window grows horizontally each time the Bismuth-184 is opened
* Tabs are counted as 1 character when pressing the arrows
* BetterText makes pasting scroll to the start of the line (typing also has this problem)
* BetterText still has visual bugs when adding to a long line if a longer line exists
* BetterText has problems when the longest line is only slighly longer than the text box (possibly because of the scrollbar)
* Closing ] doesn't highlight correctly only when in string (only sometimes)
* Control arrows don't account that "-" can be part of an int literal
* Check if umarks are computationally expensive
* Up/Down arrow keys don't work as expected with "no-wrap"
* Control-KP_8 and Control-KP_2 don't remove selections
* Control-m doesn't remove marks that are on empty lines
* Adding a shebang to an unsaved file should switch to the correct plugin
* png/jpeg/pdf viewer

IPC:
* Remove psutil dependency for checking if process exists
* Use semaphores on Windows instead of events (CreateSemaphoreA/WaitForSingleObject/ReleaseSemaphore)

Terminal:
* Add confirm close prompt when closing a running proc
* Finish implementing pty_terminal
* Add settings window
* Add a clear terminal button? (can't think of an icon for that)
* Printing ANSI characters to resize the terminal doesn't work

Notebook:
* Control-t, Control-w, Control-Shift-w don't work when no tabs are open
* Special characters (eg. \n) in the tab notches brake the UI a bit
* Control-Shift-T?

File Explorer:
* Special characters brake the UI a bit
* Save exec path on close?
* Add a tooltip to all top level folders to show their full path
* Deleting a top level folder causes problems
* Deleting an item fails if another file with same name has been deleted
* Removing a folder doesn't remove it from being cwd
* Clicking on new file/folder doesn't scroll down to the file/folder creation (we need BetterFrame.seex(int) and BetterFrame.seey(int))

BetterTk Window:
* There is a bug where `event_generate("<Control-w>")` causes a recursion error (`error_logs/error.0007.txt`)

Error Handler:
* The traceback is corrupted when a recursion error is detected (look into `error_logs` for more details)

Minor things/Low priority:
* Disable line numbers when "no-wrap"?
* Java's `RunManager` should also handle testing.
* Finish Konsole implementation (x11, windows) (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238073)
* plugins.baseplugin.py@AllPlugin.find_bracket_match is a bit slow
* Profile the whole app
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window for main window?
* A different `_handle_msg_loop` is started for each terminal.
