Editor:
* Implement the replace part of `FindReplaceManager`
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
* Java's `RunManager` should also handle testing.
* `FindReplaceManager` removes hit tag when the user adds/removes text near the hit
* Commenting a block with a comment inside it, uncomments the comment
* Control(-Shift)?-z doesn't scroll if there is text selected
* Rework BasePlugin.find_bracket_match to use BasePlugin.text_replace_tag
* On Control-j and Control-l, undo moves insert to the end of the line

Terminal:
* Windows support (pty_terminal)
* Add settings window
* Add a clear terminal button? (can't think of an icon for that)
* Printing ANSI characters to resize the terminal doesn't work
* Add confirm close prompt when closing a running proc, even on `.destroy()`
* XTerm:
	- Ctrl-Shift-\ closes xterm without closing the `TerminalFrame`

Notebook:
* Clicking on the "+" should scroll to the end
* Control-Tab/Control-Shift-Tab should scroll the tab notches

File Explorer:
* Make the frame inside the `dummy_canvas` expand to fill the canvas' width/height in `BetterFrame`. This problem also appears in `Notebook`
* Save exec path on close?
* Add a tooltip to all children of Root that show their full path
* Padding on the right of each item
* Deleting a top level folder causes problems
* An expanded folder isn't loaded correctly if it's parent is collapsed on start-up

Minor things/Low priority:
* The lines in `LineManager` go to top when reloading a file.
* Finish Konsole implementation (x11, windows)?
* plugins.baseplugin.py@AllPlugin.find_bracket_match is a bit slow
* Profile the program
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window?
