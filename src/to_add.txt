Editor:
* Implement the replace part of `FindReplaceManager`
* `FindReplaceManager` should report matches of length 0 as an error?
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
* java's `RunManager` should also handle testing.

Terminal:
* Windows support (pty_terminal)
* Add settings window
* Add a clear terminal button? (can't think of an icon for that)

Notebook:
* Clicking on the "+" should scroll to the end
* Control-Tab/Control-Shift-Tab doesn't autoscroll the tab notches

File Explorer:
* Make the frame inside the `dummy_canvas` expand to fill the canvas' width/height in `BetterFrame`. This problem also appears in `Notebook`
* Save exec path on close?

Minor things/Low priority:
* `WhiteSpaceManager` copies the indentation of the current line without considering that it might be fully enclosed in a bracket.
* The lines in `LineManager` go to top when reloading a file.
* Finnish Konsole implementation (x11, windows)?
* plugins.baseplugin.py@AllPlugin.find_bracket_match is a bit slow
* Profile the program
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window?
