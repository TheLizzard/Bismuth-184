Editor:
* Implement `FindReplaceManager`
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
* Set exec path only works when the tab that will use it is open. Add an event "<<Explorer-Report-CWD>>"
* SelectionManager` should use `.index("@x,y")` and instead should use `pos = [$w index @$x,$y]; bbox = [$w bbox $pos]; if{$bbox eq ""}{return $pos}; if {($x - [lindex $bbox 0]) < ([lindex $bbox 2]/2)}{return $pos}else{return "$pos + 1 char"}` # https://opensource.apple.com/source/tcl/tcl-107.40.1/tk/tk/library/text.tcl.auto.html

Terminal:
* Windows support (pty_terminal)
* Add settings window

Notebook:
* Clicking on the "+" should scroll to the end

File Explorer:
* Make the frame inside the `dummy_canvas` expand to fill the canvas' width/height in `BetterFrame`. This problem also appears in `Notebook`
* Save exec path on close?

Minor things/Low priority:
* `WhiteSpaceManager` copies the indentation of the current line without considering that it might be fully enclosed in a bracket.
* The lines in `LineManager` go to top when reloading a file.
* Finnish Konsole implementation (x11, windows)?
* plugins.baseplugin.py@AllPlugin.find_bracket_match is a bit slow
* Profile the program
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window?
