Editor:
* Implement the replace part of `FindReplaceManager`
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
* `FindReplaceManager` removes hit tag when the user adds/removes text near the hit
* Commenting a block with a comment inside it, uncomments the comment
* Control(-Shift)?-z doesn't scroll if there is text selected
* Rework `BasePlugin.find_bracket_match` to use `BasePlugin.text_replace_tag`
* On Control-j and Control-l, undo moves insert to the end of the line
* Unclosed bracket in `FindReplaceManager` with "whole word" fails text="a()\na(x)", search="a("
* Control-Shift-i, Control-Shift-k
* If file is deleted but latest change is save, on open, it's blank

IPC:
* Remove psutil dependency for checking if process exists
* Use semaphores instead of events (CreateSemaphoreA/WaitForSingleObject/ReleaseSemaphore)

Terminal:
* Add confirm close prompt when closing a running proc
* Windows support (pty_terminal)
* Add settings window
* Add a clear terminal button? (can't think of an icon for that)
* Printing ANSI characters to resize the terminal doesn't work
* A different `_handle_msg_loop` is started for each terminal.

Notebook:
* Clicking on the "+" should scroll to the end
* Control-Tab/Control-Shift-Tab should scroll the tab notches

File Explorer:
* Make the frame inside the `dummy_canvas` expand to fill the canvas' width/height in `BetterFrame`. This problem also appears in `Notebook`
* Save exec path on close?
* Add a tooltip to all children of Root that show their full path
* Deleting a top level folder causes problems

Minor things/Low priority:
* Java's `RunManager` should also handle testing.
* Finish Konsole implementation (x11, windows) (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238073)
* plugins.baseplugin.py@AllPlugin.find_bracket_match is a bit slow
* Profile the program
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window?

	* "TITLE_ICON_CHANGE"+pt, "ICON_CHANGE"+pt, "TITLE_CHANGE"+pt
	* "SAVE_CURSOR", "RESTORE_CURSOR"
