Editor:
* Implement `FindReplaceManager`
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands

Terminal:
* Windows support (pty_terminal)
* Add settings window

File Explorer:
* Make the frame inside the `dummy_canvas` expand to fill the canvas' width in `BetterFrame`
* Save exec path on close?

Minor things/Low priority:
* Finnish Konsole implementation (x11, windows)?
* `WhiteSpaceManager` copies the indentation of the current line without considering that it might be fully enclosed in a bracket.
* plugins.rules.bracketmanager.py@BracketManager.find_bracket_match
* Profile the program
* If the user drags the mouse outside the editor and back inside `SelectionManager` sometimes lets the "sel" tag to appear. (Shouldn't be a problem - commit version 2.3 should have made it worse)
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window?
