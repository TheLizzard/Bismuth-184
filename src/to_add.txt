Editor:
* On Windows, the window grows horizontally each time the Bismuth-184 is opened
* diff/png/jpeg/pdf viewer
[ControlIJKLManager]
* On Control-j and Control-l, undo moves insert to the end of the line
* Control-j and Control-l move the viewport to the end of the longest line
[UMarkManager]
* Check if umarks are computationally expensive
* Control-KP_8 and Control-KP_2 don't remove selections
* Control-m doesn't remove marks that are on empty lines
[FindReplaceManager]
* Implement the replace part of `FindReplaceManager`
* `FindReplaceManager` removes hit tag when re-colouring
* Unclosed bracket in `FindReplaceManager` with "whole word" fails text="a()\na(x)", search="a("
[SelectManager]
* Control arrows don't account that "-" can be part of an int literal
* Control arrows should count "???" as a full word
* Tabs are counted as 1 character when pressing the arrows
* Up/Down arrow keys don't work as expected with "no-wrap"
[CommentManager]
* Commenting a block with a comment inside it, uncomments the comment
[RunManager]
* `RunManager` can't handle passing in args when running or custom compilation/running commands
[BracketManager]
* Rework `BasePlugin.find_bracket_match` to use `BasePlugin.text_replace_tag` or use the parser from ColourManager
* Closing ] doesn't highlight correctly only when in string (only sometimes)
[BetterText]
* BetterText scrolling vertically while scrolled >max horizontally => bug
* BetterText.see end of longest line when not tk.Text.see, doesn't scroll enough
* BetterText writing to the longest visible (not actually the longest) line snaps the view
[SaveLoadManager]
* If file deleted while closed, empty Untitled page shows up
* Saving a file should update it's icon in the file explorer
* Saving file (after it has been written to with binary data), crashes the editor
[Sh/RunManager]
* When running, "$0" is wrong since we only `source` the file
[Sh/ColourManager]
* `<(...)` isn't colorized at all

IPC:
* Remove psutil dependency for checking if process exists
* Use semaphores on Windows instead of events (CreateSemaphoreA/WaitForSingleObject/ReleaseSemaphore)
* Corrupted/invalid messages don't notify the user

Terminal:
* Add confirm close prompt when closing a running proc
* Finish implementing pty_terminal
* Add settings window
* Add a clear terminal button? (can't think of an icon for that)
* Printing ANSI characters to resize the terminal doesn't work
* terminal.py@kill_proc waits 0.2 sec before sending the next signal (SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGKILL) but the messages take longer than that to arrive :/

Notebook:
* Control-t, Control-w, Control-Shift-w don't work when no tabs are open
* Special characters (eg. \n) in the tab notches brake the UI a bit
* Control-Shift-T?

File Explorer:
* Special characters break the UI a bit
* Save exec path on close?
* Deleting a top level folder causes problems
* Deleting an item fails if another file with same name has been deleted
* Removing a folder doesn't remove it from being cwd
* Clicking on new file/folder doesn't scroll down to the file/folder creation (we need BetterFrame.seex(int) and BetterFrame.seey(int))
* Adding a shebang to an unsaved file should switch to the correct plugin
* Renaming a file/folder in the explorer should update the paths in notebook

BetterTk Window:
* There is a bug where `event_generate("<Control-w>")` causes a recursion error (`error_logs/error.0007.txt`)

Error Handler:
* The traceback is corrupted when a recursion error is detected (`error_logs/?` for more details)

Minor things/Low priority/Impossible to fix:
* Disable line numbers when "no-wrap"?
* Java's `RunManager` should also handle testing.
* Finish Konsole implementation (x11, windows) (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238073)
* Profile the whole app
* Implement `MenuManager`?
* Add settings window for main window?
* A different `_handle_msg_loop` is started for each terminal.
* "𒀃" is counted as 2 characters instead of 1 character in `BarManager`
* Control(-Shift)?-z doesn't scroll if there is text selected

LSP:
* Look into language server protocols again (there are more and more official)
